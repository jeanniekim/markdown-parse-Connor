Hello I am writing text and I'm going to use brakets and parenthesis somewhat randomly in a way that I would normally write it.

here is random example of code 
```
public static void main(String[]){
    int[] something = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    System.out.println(something);
}
```

and now here is an actual image link

consecutive link test [first link](https://www.youtube.com)[second link](https://jstris.jezevec10.com)

space in the link section test [space link](https:// thishas a space)

\n test [
    this has a \n in the text
](doesitwork.com)

[this has a \n in the link](doesit
work.com)

[reference test][ref]

[reference without the colon space][ref2]
